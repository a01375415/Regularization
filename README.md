# Customer Churn Analysis Using Regularization Regression

This assignment involves a detailed analysis of the Customer Churn Dataset using regularization regression techniques. Our focus will be on applying Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression methods to select features, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Overview

1. **Data Splitting**
    - Training Data: 80%
    - Test Data: 20%
    - Address any class imbalance with appropriate strategies.

2. **Feature Selection**
    - Utilize Lasso, Ridge, or Elastic Net for feature selection.
    - Goal: Identify key features for predicting customer churn.
    - Analyze regularization results in multicollinearity vs. logistic regression with singular effects.

3. **Model Building**
    - Construct models using Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression.
    - Perform hyperparameter tuning for each method.
    - Generate predictions on the test set.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Use relevant metrics to evaluate model performance on the test set.
    - Compare Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net models.
    - Discuss the impact of different regularization techniques on this problem.
    - Compare the final model against best practices in Logistic regression.
    - Determine the most suitable method for this dataset.

## Conclusion

The aim of this project is to explore various regularization regression methods in the context of customer churn prediction. By comparing these techniques with standard logistic regression practices, we aim to establish the most effective approach for this type of analysis.
